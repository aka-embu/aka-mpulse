Akamai mPulse SDK for Android
===================================================


MOBILE APP PERFORMANCE
--------------------
Akamaiâ€™s mPulse SDK allows you to monitor network and app telemetry. This allows you to see, in real-time, how your app performs. You can set up thresholds and alerts, and get granular visibility into how end users perceive performance. With this information you can identify views that matter the most, and answer critical questions, such as "How much impact does the performance have on conversions or session length?" You can also determine which things, for example third-party scripts, are slowing you down. The mPulse SDK maximizes your business outcomes by prioritizing enhancements that matter.
